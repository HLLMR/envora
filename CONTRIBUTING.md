## Contributing (Internal)

This is a **private, proprietary** repository. Do not share code or screenshots outside approved channels.

### Local development

- Copy `env.example` to `.env` and set `SA_PASSWORD`
- Start the stack:
  - `docker compose up -d --build`
- App:
  - `http://localhost:8080/`

### Branching / PRs

- Use short-lived feature branches off `main`
- Keep PRs small and focused
- Prefer adding docs alongside code for new subsystems
